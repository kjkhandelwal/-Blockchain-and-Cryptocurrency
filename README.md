# -Blockchain-and-Cryptocurrency
Aim of the proposed project is to develop a novel method for decentralized, peer
to peer web posting application using cryptocurrency blockchain technology to
ameliorate user privacy, utilize all the available advantages of a blockchain
network, with potential to scale to a multifarious platform, eradicate platform
controlled censorship, and to provide a mechanism for curation of web posts
feed by inclusion of cryptocurrency framework as mode of tipping The
proposed application includes account creation and connection with help of
blockchain, where they would act as a node in the network The posts are to be
uploaded directly to the blockchain in order to avail all of its prevailing
advantages In order to achieve the web posts feed curation, a novel Post
Tipping methodology is to be used, thereby utilizing both of the prominent
pillars of Blockchain technology cryptocurrency and decentralization Hence,striving
to develop the proposed Posting Application which can also be modified
to be utilized and adopted by any private organization as internal medium of
communication among the members The objective behind the newsfeed
curation is also to provide a web posting platform that promotes mental well
being, and negates hate speech, showcasing only the quality content appealing
to the masses The aim also includes to achieve user data privacy and security
through complete elimination of central servers which can be easily tampered
with, and achieve decentralization in the process Another vital objective of the
proposed work is to achieve transparency and immutability in all the
transactions taking place, which can be achieved through the proposed
Blockchain framework (since all the transactions will be uploaded to the chain
network, containing the public key of the parties involved in the transactions
powered through smart contracts, and these transactions being visible to every
user connected in the blockchain, hence achieving transparency in the process).
